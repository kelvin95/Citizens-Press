# Citizens-Press

Citizen Press offers anonymous individuals the opportunity to offer society the fundamental truths, and thus free thought. In the present age, free thought itself has been trampled upon because rarely anyone recognizes the significance of genuine opinion. What is at stake is not the restriction of thought, but the field of information that is presented.
